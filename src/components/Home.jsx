            We are not running to push our own agenda â€“ we're running to carry
            yours. We want to listen to what the citizens have to say and work
            to fix those concerns. A part of that is increasing transparency and
            communication of the borough with the residents. We believe Lyons
            has a lot of potential and we can tap into it together. Our town's
            history illustrates a place that used to be bustling and lively. We
            have the opportunity to revive it together!
