For Borough Council

ON NOVEMBER 4  
Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day. Remember, if you are in line by 8 p.m., you can vote.

## **Our Vision**

We are not running to push our own agenda – we’re running to carry yours. We want to listen to what the citizens have to say and work to fix those concerns. A part of that is increasing transparency and communication of the borough with the residents. We believe Lyons has a lot of potential and we can tap into it together. Our town’s history illustrates a place that used to be bustling and lively. We have the opportunity to revive it together\!

## **Top Concerns**

From listening to the residents of Lyons, here is what we found to be the top 5 issues:

1. Having it so the sewer bill can be paid online  
2. Speeding issues  
3. Stray cat issue  
4. Stormwater & Snow concerns  
5. Blighted properties

We are dedicated as a slate to tackling these concerns. Learn more about our proposed solutions in our solutions section.

# **Our Solutions**

## **Sewer Bill Being Paid Online**

We'll build a new, modern website where residents can pay their sewer bills online. In-person payments will still be available

## **Speeding Issues**

We plan to add tree-lined sidewalks that naturally slow down traffic and make our town more walkable and beautiful.

## **Stray Cat Issue**

We want to partner with local nonprofits to start a humane catch-and-release program for stray cats.

## **Stormwater & Snow Concerns**

We'll work with nearby boroughs and townships to share costs and improve snow removal and salting. We will also invest in better stormwater systems to reduce flooding.

## **Blighted Properties**

We support a new ordinance to address neglected properties.  
We also want to shift from a property tax to a land value tax, which rewards productive use and could lower taxes on average for most residents.

We’re committed to restoring historic sites such as with the old fire company building.
